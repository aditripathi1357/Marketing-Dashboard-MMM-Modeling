# Marketing Mix Modeling with Advanced XGBoost Pipeline

## üéØ Executive Summary

This project implements an **advanced two-stage XGBoost model** for Marketing Mix Modeling that captures the mediation effect between social media channels and search advertising. The model assumes that social media spend (Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat) drives search intent, which then translates to Google spend, ultimately leading to revenue generation.

**Key Model Performance:**
- **Stage 1 (Social ‚Üí Google Spend)**: R¬≤ = 0.932
- **Stage 2 (All Channels ‚Üí Revenue)**: R¬≤ = 0.925
- **Cross-Validation Performance**: R¬≤ = -1.411 ¬± 1.855 (with high variance indicating overfitting challenges)
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Professional Streamlit application with real-time scenario analysis

### Repository Structure
```
MMM-Assignment/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This comprehensive documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                # Main Streamlit dashboard application
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ generate_dataset.py   # Sample data generator (optional)
```

### Core Architecture

The model implements a **causal mediation framework**:

```
Social Media Spend ‚Üí Search Intent ‚Üí Google Spend ‚Üí Revenue
    (Stage 1: XGBoost)              (Stage 2: XGBoost)
```

This approach:
- Respects the theoretical assumption that social media drives search behavior
- Prevents direct attribution leakage from social to revenue
- Enables proper channel attribution and budget optimization
- Provides interpretable business insights for marketing strategy

## üîß Model Architecture & Implementation

### Two-Stage XGBoost Pipeline

**Stage 1: Social Channels ‚Üí Google Spend Prediction**

```python
stage1_params = {
    'objective': 'reg:squarederror',
    'learning_rate': 0.1,           # Optimized for social‚Üísearch relationships
    'max_depth': 3,                 # Prevents overfitting on interaction terms
    'subsample': 0.8,               # Bootstrap sampling for robustness
    'colsample_bytree': 0.8,        # Feature sampling for generalization
    'reg_alpha': 0.1,               # L1 regularization for feature selection
    'reg_lambda': 1.0,              # L2 regularization for stability
    'seed': 42
}
```

**Features Used:**
- Log-transformed social media spend: `log(spend + 1)` to handle zeros
- Interaction features: `fb_tiktok_interaction`
- Aggregate features: `social_total_log`
- Adstock transformations: Exponential decay for carryover effects

**Stage 2: All Channels ‚Üí Revenue Prediction**

```python
stage2_params = {
    'objective': 'reg:squarederror',
    'learning_rate': 0.08,          # Slightly lower for complex revenue model
    'max_depth': 4,                 # Deeper trees for revenue complexity
    'subsample': 0.85,              # Higher sampling for stability
    'colsample_bytree': 0.9,        # More features for revenue prediction
    'reg_alpha': 0.05,              # Less L1 regularization
    'reg_lambda': 0.8,              # Moderate L2 for generalization
    'seed': 42
}
```

**Features Used:**
- Predicted Google spend from Stage 1
- Direct marketing channels: `email_sends`, `sms_sends`
- Price and promotion factors: `avg_price`, `promotions`
- Brand metrics: `followers`

### Advanced Data Preprocessing

**Feature Engineering:**
```python
# Log transformations for spend variables
df['facebook_spend_log'] = np.log1p(df['facebook_spend'])
df['tiktok_spend_log'] = np.log1p(df['tiktok_spend'])
df['snapchat_spend_log'] = np.log1p(df['snapchat_spend'])

# Interaction features
df['social_total_log'] = df['facebook_spend_log'] + df['tiktok_spend_log'] + df['snapchat_spend_log']
df['fb_tiktok_interaction'] = df['facebook_spend_log'] * df['tiktok_spend_log']

# Adstock transformation (carryover effects)
for col in ['facebook_spend', 'tiktok_spend', 'snapchat_spend']:
    df[f'{col}_adstock'] = df[col].ewm(alpha=0.3).mean()
```

**Data Quality Handling:**
- Missing value imputation with zeros for spend variables
- Date parsing and temporal sorting for time series consistency
- StandardScaler normalization for XGBoost input features
- Outlier detection and treatment for revenue variables

## üìä Model Performance Analysis

### Actual Performance Results

Based on the dashboard implementation and screenshots:

**Stage 1 Performance (Social ‚Üí Google Spend):**
- **R¬≤ Score**: 0.932 (93.2% of Google spend variance explained)
- **RMSE**: 485 (Average prediction error: ¬±$485)
- **MAE**: 401 (Median absolute error)
- **MAPE**: 20,198,472,784.62% (Note: High MAPE due to zero-spend handling)

**Stage 2 Performance (All Channels ‚Üí Revenue):**
- **R¬≤ Score**: 0.925 (92.5% of revenue variance explained)
- **RMSE**: 25,463 (Average prediction error: ¬±$25,463)
- **MAE**: 18,889 (Median absolute error)
- **MAPE**: 87,653.9% (High due to percentage calculation with low baseline values)

### Cross-Validation Results

**Time Series Cross-Validation (5-fold):**
- **CV R¬≤**: -1.411 ¬± 1.855
- **CV RMSE**: 104,050 ¬± 33,999
- **CV MAE**: 65,050 ¬± 27,535
- **CV MAPE**: 165,901.3% ¬± 142,939%

**Note on Cross-Validation Performance:**
The negative R¬≤ in cross-validation indicates **overfitting challenges** typical in marketing mix models with limited data. This suggests:
- Model performs well on training data but struggles with out-of-sample prediction
- Time series patterns may not generalize across different periods
- Regularization parameters may need adjustment
- Additional validation approaches might be beneficial

### Feature Importance Analysis

**Stage 1 Feature Importance (Social ‚Üí Google):**
The dashboard provides interactive feature importance visualization showing relative contribution of each social media channel to Google spend prediction.

**Stage 2 Feature Importance (All ‚Üí Revenue):**
Interactive visualization shows how predicted Google spend, direct channels, and control variables contribute to revenue prediction.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Model Limitations & Risk Assessment

### Statistical Limitations

**Cross-Validation Concerns:**
- Negative CV R¬≤ indicates potential overfitting
- High variance across validation folds suggests instability
- Time series patterns may not generalize well
- Regularization may need strengthening

**Data Assumptions:**
- **Mediation Assumption**: All social impact flows through Google (may not capture direct brand effects)
- **Linear Relationships**: XGBoost can capture non-linearity but assumes consistent patterns
- **Stationarity**: Model assumes stable relationships over time
- **No External Shocks**: Competitive actions, economic changes not explicitly modeled

### Business Decision Risks

**Attribution Complexity:**
- Social channels may be undervalued due to indirect attribution
- Google receives credit for social-driven conversions
- Internal stakeholder alignment on methodology required

**Implementation Risks:**
- Model recommendations assume ceteris paribus conditions
- Scale limitations not explicitly captured (saturation effects)
- External market changes could invalidate historical relationships

### Recommended Risk Mitigations

**Model Validation:**
- Implement holdout testing in addition to cross-validation
- A/B testing to validate mediation assumptions
- Regular model retraining with expanding data windows
- External benchmark comparisons for sanity checks

**Business Guardrails:**
- Gradual implementation of model recommendations
- Budget change limits (e.g., max 20% month-over-month changes)
- Performance monitoring dashboards with alert thresholds
- Regular stakeholder reviews of attribution methodology
